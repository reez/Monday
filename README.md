## Thanks

[@notmandatory](https://github.com/notmandatory) for getting this up and running with me on a Monday.

[@tnull](https://github.com/tnull) most importantly. 

The [Lightning Dev Kit](https://lightningdevkit.org) team/project and the [Bitcoin Dev Kit](https://bitcoindevkit.org/) team/project, LDK Node is built using both.
